JENKIN : automate SDLC ---> developer put code in github.com --.jenkin picked up code from github.com --->> to maven (build)-->>> test (building is succefful so test--if something wrong with the code (jenkin will infor the developer to fix before going to QA) ----->>QA---->to delievery)           
competitor of jenkin
travis, CI cicrcle, Bamboo, gatelab 
jenkin is open source tool meaning is free, it works with all kind of operating system

JDK 8,11 : add enviroment variables
github          steps to lunch Jenkinsbcv
maven
jenkins
how to lunch instances : go to aws selete EC2 and click on instance
---> create ec2 name , select windows and create key pair  , scroll and click 
---->allow HTTP tracffic -----------> allow Http
connect your instance using RDP clicnt --->>>> generate password----->>>> select the download remote machine and 
lunch remote window
----> click on window and select server manager
 ----->>>>click local server ---->>> turn off IE enhancement
----------->>>download chrome cuz jenkin will not run with internete expl

first step to lunch jenskin 
--->install git for windown ( you must do this steps for every new project to set up jenkin in a new server)
--->> select git pack and click on 64 git for window
---->>>>run git and click next next n install

create new acc is free and confirm your email nad it will dirct
 check ur system to see that java is completely install
----->> go to file--->>this pc--->local dick-->>program file-->.java---->> jdk11.

   for jenkins to run it request JDK11 (java) to be installed
ENviroment variable next step -- to acknowlege jenkin jave is running
   
		 SET UP ENVIROMENT VARAIBLES
---->>>
 search enviroment variable  --->> click on enviroment variable
creat variable for user and system
-----> create new vavriable (Variable name and add link)
excutable file will be avalable in bin
---->>> double click on path in system variable and 
     add exec bin C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.17\bin
NEXT STEP

INSTALL MAVEN

google and enter intall maven and click the first site
click on download and select
	binary zip archive   -  apaches-maven
	downlaod apache ---> go to file 
	copy and paste on PC drive(c drive)
 next add apache to enviroment variable to both user and system
 
	  add path apach/bin Final step downlaod jenkin
  # jenkins download and delopyment
    scrool and download windowns
  next jenkin run on a poll 8080
code 8080 need to be enable in the ec2 /window machine
---->. go aws ec2 machine
